Three patients were treated. Patients received infusion of tri-virus cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, transduced with a first generation GD2 targeted chimeric antigen receptor (tvs-CTL). Infusion of the tvs-CTL was performed 30 to 120 days after reduced intensity, mismatched related donor, CD34 selected peripheral blood stem cell transplant on a separate clinical trial. The tvs-CTL were derived from the stem cell transplant donor. Patients were monitored for safety of the allogeneic tvs-CTL at infusion and for adverse events such as graft vs host disease and insertional mutagenesis/carcinogenesis related to the gene transduction.

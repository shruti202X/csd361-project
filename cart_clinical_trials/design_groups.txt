If no dose limited toxicity (DLT) occurs, next level will be assessed for DLT. If DLT occurs in one subject, 3 more subjects will be enrolled in this cohort for the evaluation of DLT. If DLT occurs in ≤ 1/6 subjects, next level will be assessed for DLT. If DLT occurs in ≥ 2 subjects, no more subjects will be enrolled in this cohort and dose escalation will be canceled. For each cohort, following subjects can only receive CT125A infusion at least 14 days after the first subject received CT125A infusion. If DLT occurs in 2 subjects at Dose Level 1, whether to explore a lower dose will be determined by the investigator.

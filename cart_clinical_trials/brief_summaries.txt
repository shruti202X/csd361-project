33189926|NCT05202782|This phase II trial studies the effect of zanubrutinib and CAR T-cell therapy in treating patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or transformed indolent B-cell lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Zanubrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to recognize CAR, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CAR-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill cancer cells. Giving zanubrutinib together with CAR T-cell therapy may kill more cancer cells.

Study outcomes will contribute to knowledge about if and how a digital health intervention may be used to support individuals post-CAR T cell therapy."
33005742|NCT04712864|This is a Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter, study of LB1901 administered to adult subjects with histologically confirmed CD4+ relapsed or refractory Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (PTCL not otherwise specified [PTCL-NOS] and angioimmunoblastic [AITL]), or relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (Sézary syndrome [SS] and mycosis fungoides [MF]).
33190453|NCT04219163|"Patients eligible for this study have a type of blood cancer Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) which has come back or has not gone away after treatment.~The body has different ways of fighting disease and infection, and this research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer with antibodies and T cells with the hope that they will work together. T cells (also called T lymphocytes) are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other infectious diseases. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients when used alone.~T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person. The antibody used in this study targets CLL-1. This antibody sticks to AML cells because of a substance (protein) on the outside of these cells called CLL-1. For this study, the antibody to CLL-1 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. When T-cells contain an antibody that is joined to them, they are called chimeric antigen receptor T-cells or CAR-T cells.~In the laboratory, the investigators have also found that T cells work better if proteins that stimulate T cells are also added, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells. In this study we are going to attach the CLL-1 chimeric receptor that has CD28 added to it to the patient's T cells. We will then test how long the cells last.~These CLL-1 chimeric antigen receptor T cells with CD28 are investigational products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration."

33006487|NCT03617198|This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat HIV. As part of this study, doctors will take some of your own white blood cells, called T-cells, and modify them so that they can identify and target your HIV cells. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of these modified T cells and determine whether they have any effect on HIV infection.
33006508|NCT02844062|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells can mediate long-term durable remissions in recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies, and are a promising therapy to treat glioblastoma, which is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer. EGFRvIII mutation (epidermal growth factor receptor variant III, EGFRvIII) is the results of tumor specific gene rearrangement naturally happened in about 30% of glioblastoma patients and produces a mutated protein with neo-antigen that is tumor specific and is not expressed in normal human tissues. Therefore, EGFRvIII is an attractive target for CAR T cell therapy. We have constructed a lentiviral vector that contains a chimeric antigen receptor that recognizes the EGFRvIII tumor antigen. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the CAR vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CAR T cells in necessary. This pilot study is to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous anti-EGFRvIII CAR T cells in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person. In some patients who have recently had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, the number of T cells in their blood may not be enough to grow in the laboratory. In this situation, T cells may be collected from their previous transplant donor, who has a similar tissue type.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD5. It first came from mice that have developed immunity to human leukemia. This antibody sticks to T-cell leukemia or lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD5. CD5 antibodies have been used to treat people with T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. For this study, anti-CD5 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells.

The investigators will then test how long the cells last. The decision to use the bone marrow transplant donor's T cells instead of the patient's will be based on 1) whether there is an available and willing donor and 2) the likelihood of the patient's T cells being able to grow in the lab. These CD5 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 are investigational products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration."

T-cells will be engineered to express a second generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) named T1E28z. Engineered T-cells will be injected directly into the tumour site. Patients will not be lymphodepleted. A classical 3+3 design will be employed, with dose escalation from 10^7 through to 10^9 transduced T4+ T-cells, dependent upon toxicity monitoring.

No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2). This antibody sticks to GBM cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called HER2. Up to 80% of GBMs are positive for HER2. HER2 antibodies have been used to treat people with HER2-positive cancers. For this study, the HER2 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric receptor-T cells seem to be able to kill tumors like GBM, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited. Therefore, developing ways to prolong the life of these T cells should help them fight cancer.~We found that T cells work better if we also attach a protein called CD28 to the HER2 chimeric receptor (HER2-CAR). In this study we placed this HER2-CAR into T cells that were pre-selected for their ability to recognize Cytomegalovirus (CMV). This virus exists in most people. These CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CMV-T cells) will be more active since they will react to the virus as well as to tumor cells. These HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.~The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with GBM."

Investigators now want to see if a new gene can be put in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma and neuroblastoma cells. The new gene is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and consists of an antibody called 14g2a that recognizes GD2, a protein that is found on sarcoma and neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). In addition, it contains parts of the CD28 and OX40 genes which can stimulate T cells to make them live longer.~Investigators have found that CAR-T cells can kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long in the body and so the tumor eventually comes back. T cells that recognize the virus that causes chicken pox, varicella zoster virus (VZV), remain in the bloodstream for many years especially if they are stimulated or boosted by the VZV vaccine.

33010285|NCT05379569|"Comparing the efficacy and safety of fludarabine-containing BFC conditioning regimen with traditional BuCy conditioning regimen in Acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia patients who treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, to establish a conditioning regimen for improving the survival rate of patients with B-cell ALL after transplantation.~Acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematologic malignancy . The incidence of B-All is higher in children than in adults, but more than 80% of children patients can be cured by chemotherapy, while the survival rate of adult patients is less than 40%. Recurrence or progression of the disease is the main reason affecting the survival of patients.~Although CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy is an effective salvage treatment for relapsed and refractory B-ALL, bridging allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required after remission. 1-year LFS and 1-year OS were 11.6% and 32% in patients without bridging grafts after CAR T.~Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment for ALL. Before the transplant, patients receive high doses of chemotherapy plus or total body irradiation（TBI） to 'creation of space' ，immunosuppression and disease eradication. This is called conditioning regimen. Conditioning regimen plays a key role in reducing tumor load and diseaseconditioning regimen recurrence.~Conditioning regimen for different diseases are different. Conditioning regimen are based on TBI and chemotherapy BuCy, with low TBI recurrence rate but high treatment-related mortality (TRM). BuCY chemotherapy had low TRM but high recurrence rate, so there was no difference in total OS. Therefore, it is of great clinical value to explore a conditioning regimenprogram. How to optimize the preconditioning program before transplantation, so as to reduce the recurrence rate and prolong the survival period of adult B-cell ALL patients after transplantation has become a issue that needs to be solved urgently in clinical practice.~BFC (Malilane + fludarabine + cyclophosphamide) is the addition of fludarabine to BuCy (malilane + cyclophosphamide). The combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide has synergistic effect, which can better kill B lymphocyte, and can enhance the killing effect of pretreatment regimen on B lymphocyte tumor."

32827609|NCT02663297|"The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.~In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical structure carrying the patient's genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody floats around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called lymphoma cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the lymphoma cells is attached to the T cells instead of the entire antibody. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.~The purpose of this research study is to determine a safe dose of the ATLCAR.CD30 cells that can be given to subjects after undergoing an autologous transplant. This is the first step in determining whether giving ATLCAR.CD30 cells to others with lymphoma in the future will help them. The researchers also want to find out what side effects patients will have after they receive the ATLCAR.CD30 cells post-transplant. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on your cancer and how long they will survive in your body."

The therapy used in this study is T Cell Receptor (TCR) Gene Therapy Targeting KK-LC-1, a cancer germline antigen that is expressed by certain cancers. This therapy is a type of treatment in which a participant s T cells (a type of immune system white blood cell) are changed in the laboratory to attack cancer cells and given back to the participant. This treatment might help people with KK-LC-1 positive cancers which may include gastric, breast, cervical, lung and other epithelial Cancers. Epithelial cancers are cancers that begin in the cells that line an organ.~Objective:~The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of different doses of KK-LC-1 TCR T cells plus aldesleukin to treat metastatic or refractory/recurrent KK-LC-1 positive cancers.~Eligibility:~Adults aged 18 and older with metastatic or refractory/recurrent KK-LC-1 positive epithelial cancer.~Design:~Participants will be screened with HLA typing (a blood test needed for eligibility) and KK-LC-1 testing of the cancer tumor (to determine if the cancer is KK-LC-1 positive). A new biopsy may be needed if tumor from an outside location is not available for KK-LC-1 testing. Eligible participants will come to the NIH campus to have a screening evaluation which will include physical exam, review of medical history and current medications, blood and heart tests, imaging (X-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET scan), and evaluation of participant s veins that are used for drawing blood.~If the participant is eligible for the study based on the screening evaluation, they will have a baseline evaluation prior to receiving the experimental treatment which may include additional laboratory or imaging tests.~Participants will have a large IV catheter inserted into a vein to undergo a procedure called leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is the removal of the blood by a machine to collect specific white blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body. This procedure is needed to collect the cells that will be modified to target the cancer. The cells are grown in the lab and given back to the participant through an injection into the participant's tumor. It takes 11-15 days to grow the cells.~While the cells are growing, the participant will be admitted to the hospital about one week~before the cell infusion to receive 2 types of chemotherapy through an IV catheter over 5 days. The main purpose of the chemotherapy is to make the cells more effective in fighting the cancer tumors. The cells will be given 1-2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. Within 24 hours after the cell infusion, participants will be given a cell growth factor called aldesleukin through an IV for up to 4 days. Aldesleukin is thought to help the cells live longer in the participant s body. Participants will recover in the hospital until they are well enough to go home, which is usually about 7-12 days after the cell infusion or last dose of aldesleukin.~Participants will have a follow-up visit at approximately 40 days after the date of cell infusion. This visit will be to evaluate the safety of the cell therapy and the response of the cancer to the treatment which will include physical examination, lab tests, and imaging studies. If a participant has stable disease or their cancer has responded to the treatment, they will be seen again at 12 weeks post cell infusion, every 3 months x 3 visits, and then every 6 months x 5 years. If a participant s cancer progresses after this therapy, they will be return to their home doctor for further management.~After receiving cell therapy, participants will be followed on a long-term gene therapy protocol. Participants will have blood drawn periodically to test if the cells have grown or changed. These blood tests will take place immediately before the cells, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months for the first year and possibly annually thereafter based on the results.

32926154|NCT01853631|"Subjects on this study have a type of lymph gland cancer called Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (these diseases will be referred to as lymphoma or leukemia). The lymphoma or leukemia has come back or has not gone away after treatment.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No one way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease, antibodies and T cells, hoping that they will work together. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancer. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~T cells can kill tumor cells but normally there are not enough of them to kill all the tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. It first came from mice that have developed immunity to human lymphoma. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma and leukemia. For this study, anti-CD19 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.~In the laboratory, the investigators found that T cells work better if they also add proteins that stimulate T cells, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells last longer in the body but not long enough for them to be able to kill the lymphoma cells. The investigators believe that if they add an extra stimulating protein, called CD137, the cells will have a better chance of killing the lymphoma cells.~The investigators are going to see if this is true by putting the CD19 chimeric receptor with CD28 alone into half of the cells and the CD19 chimeric receptor with CD28 and CD137 into the other half of the cells. These CD19 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 and with or without CD137 are investigational products not approved by the FDA.~The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe, to see how long the T cell with each sort of chimeric receptor lasts, to learn what the side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help people with lymphoma or leukemia."
33015194|NCT04185038|"This is a Phase 1 study of central nervous system (CNS) locoregional adoptive therapy with autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lentivirally transduced to express a B7H3-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and EGFRt. CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.~A child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meeting none of the exclusion criteria, will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets B7H3-expressing tumor cells. Patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on location or type of their tumor. Patients with supratentorial tumors will be assigned to Arm A, and will receive their treatment into the tumor cavity. Patients with either infratentorial or metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors will be assigned to Arm B, and will have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The first 3 patients enrolled onto the study must be at least 15 years of age and assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Patients with DIPG will be assigned to Arm C and have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The patient's newly engineered T cells will be administered via the indwelling catheter for two courses. In the first course patients in Arms A and B will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses for three weeks. Patients in Arm C will receive a dose of CAR T cells every other week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then dosing every other week for 3 weeks. Following the two courses, patients in all Arms will undergo a series of studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to continue receiving additional courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.~The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of B7H3-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to complete two courses of treatment with 3 or 2 doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that B7H3-specific CAR T cells can safely be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter or delivered directly into the brain via indwelling catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples from multiple timepoints are available, also evaluate disease response to B7-H3 CAR T cell locoregional therapy."

33015382|NCT02715362|Intravenous infusion of CART cells in the treatment of solid tumors may be not a suitable choice. Because by intravenous infusion, T cells first entered into the blood circulation, but the number of T cells accumulated at the tumor site is limited, while the probability is high that CART cells contact with normal tissue where target protein is expressed, leading to a more potential off-target side effect. In this study, CART cells infused to the body is mediated by the method of transcatheter arterial infusion(TAI), which is one kind of tumor intervention therapy pathway. We hope by this means could improve the local CAR-T cell numbers，meanwhile reduce the potential side effects.
33015657|NCT02706782|Pancreatic carcinoma typically has a high recurrence rate and very poor prognosis. Surgery is the best choice for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but for those advanced pancreatic cancer patients，when surgery is not available，chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy or interventional therapy is commonly used in the treatment，but the prolonging survival effect is not obvious. And now, some clinical researchers use CAR-T cells in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma, according to the existing results, therapeutic effects are not as good as expecting. One of the most likely reasons is that they continued to use the intravenous infusing of CART cells to patients, when the T cells into the blood circulation, will result in decreased tumor activity and more potential adverse effects. We believe that a suitable TAA targeted-CAR-T cells will be an effective way to treat cancer, as long as the pathway of the cell infused to the body can not only improve the drug concentration of the tumor site but reduce the potential off-target side effects. In order to achieve this goal, it is probably the best choice to use vascular intervention to mediate CAR-T cells infusion. Mesothelin is a cell-surface antigen implicated in tumor invasion, which is highly expressed in pancreatic carcinoma but low-level expressed in mesothelia. We design a 2nd CART cells targeted with mesothelin, and use vascular intervention mediated CAR-T infusion to patients. We hope deliver anti-mesothelin CART cells locally can reducing the side effects while enhancing the antitumor affect by more CART cells accumulate in tumor sites while less can reach normal mesothelial tissue.

33017713|NCT04186052|Multiple myeloma is a kind of hematological malignancy caused by the proliferation of malignant clonal plasma cells. In recent years, the emergence of new therapeutic drugs such as bortezomib and lenalidomide has significantly improved the therapeutic effect of mm. However, due to the presence of myeloma stem cells, most patients will inevitably relapse and die. With the development of biomedicine and immunology, immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells has attracted great attention for its amazing efficacy. CAR-T cells carry receptors that can specifically recognize myeloma associated antigens, and their killing effect is not limited by MHC molecules. B-cell mature antigen is only expressed on the surface of B cells in germinal center, malignant and normal plasma cells, not on other normal human tissues and CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells. It is a relatively specific high expression on the surface of myeloma cells, which is an ideal target for MM immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of BCMA targeted T cell infusion in the treatment of BCMA positive multiple myeloma.
33018209|NCT04184414|"CD19 is expressed in most B malignant tumors, especially in the former B cells ALL. This makes CD19 a natural target of immunotherapy. In terms of safety, the lack of B cells caused by CD19 targeted therapy will not cause life-threatening side effects (of course, Ig supplementation is necessary in the long-term B cell inhibition therapy). Moreover, the number of B cells can be restored after removing anti-CD19 treatment measures (such as anti-CD19 CART cells). In addition, CD19 has been chosen as the target of B-ALL therapy for the following reasons: ① as the BCR signal amplifier, CD19 plays a role in PAX-5-mediated tumor formation; ② by activating MYC (as the oncogene controlled by PAX-5, C-MYC plays a key role in promoting the malignant proliferation of B cells), CD19 can cause B-ALL formation. Based on the above reasons, CD19 has become an ideal target in the treatment of B-cell cancer."

Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to cancer cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma and leukemia. For this study, the CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.

Recently, cancer immunotherapy, treatments aiming to arm patients with immunity specifically against cancer cells, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Among the many emerging immunotherapeutic approaches, clinical trials utilizing CARs against B cell malignancies have demonstrated remarkable potential. CARs combine the variable region of an antibody with T-cell signaling moieties to confer T-cell activation with the targeting specificity of an antibody. Thus, CARs are not MHC-restricted so they are not vulnerable to MHC down regulation by tumors. However, defined by the recession of evaluable lesions, the persistence and efficacy of CAR-T cells are still restricted by the target selection. Previous clinical studies largely utilized CD19 for the in vivo targeting of CAR-T cells, which preferentially become refractory or resistant due to the heterogeneity of lymphoma.

33027609|NCT05010564|"This is a gene transfer study for patients with a type of blood cancer called Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) that has come back or has not gone away after treatment.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For example, T lymphocytes can kill cancer cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the cancer cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person.~The antibody used in this study targets CD19, CD20 and CD22. This antibody sticks to ALL cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19, CD20 and/or CD22. For this study, the antibody to CD19, CD20 and CD22 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. When T-cells contain an antibody that is joined to them, they are called chimeric antigen receptor- T cells or CAR-T cells.~In the laboratory, we have also found that T cells work better if we also add proteins that stimulate them. One such protein is called 4-1BB. Adding the 4-1BB molecule makes the cells grow better and last longer in the body, giving them a better chance of killing the leukemia cells. In this study we are going to attach the CD19/CD20/CD22 chimeric receptor that has 4-1BB added to the patient's T cells. We will then test how long the cells last.~These T cells, called TRICAR-ALL T cells are investigational products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."

33110421|NCT04903080|This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety profile of a type of immune therapy called HER2 CAR T cells (short for HER2 chimeric antigen receptor T cells). In addition to looking for side effects, we will study how well this treatment works against a brain tumor called ependymoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent) or has not responded well to treatment (progressive) in children. The HER2 CAR T cells used in this trial are made from the patient's own blood. A new gene, called the HER2 CAR, will be inserted into patient's T cells to allow them recognize a protein on the tumor called HER2. These HER2-specific CAR T cells may be able to target and kill ependymoma tumors that express HER2. This research is also studying how doable it is to provide this type of CAR T cell treatment to children being treated at different hospitals.

We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.~In this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.~Investigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.

Genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving rituximab together with chemotherapy before a PBSCT stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim (G-CSF), or plerixafor helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. More chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant.

32939097|NCT04650724|"Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (car-t) is one of the most effective therapies for malignant tumors (especially hematological tumors). Like other immunotherapies, the basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to clear cancer cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (car) is the core component of car-t, which endows T cells with the ability to recognize tumor antigens in an independent manner, which enables car modified T cells to recognize a wider range of targets than natural T cell surface receptors (TCR). The basic design of car includes a tumor associated antigen binding region (usually derived from scFv segment of monoclonal antibody antigen binding region), transmembrane region and intracellular signal region. The selection of target antigen is a key determinant for the specificity and effectiveness of car and the safety of genetically modified T cells.~BCMA is a specific surface protein of B lymphocytes, which plays an important role in the development, proliferation and differentiation of B cells. BCMA is highly expressed in malignant mm plasma cells and provides a large number of anti apoptotic signals, which makes bcam an ideal target in targeted immunotherapy. At present, a variety of immunotherapy strategies targeting BCMA are being carried out in laboratory and clinical practice, which have achieved encouraging therapeutic effects in multiple myeloma and effectively promoted the development of targeted immunotherapy."

32839951|NCT02690545|"The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.~In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.~The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer."

Patients with recurrent glioblastoma will have surgical treatment and pathological test for target expression at their home institution or at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. If the tumor is target positive and the patient meets all other eligibility criteria, and meets none of the exclusion criteria, will have Ommaya reservoir implantation, and a subsequent Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) collection. T cells will then be isolated from the PBMC sample and then be bioengineered in to a 4th generation CAR-T cell, Tris-CAR-T cells. Recipients with Ommaya reservoir implanted will be assigned to three courses. The first 2 patients will be assigned to low dose group, and will have one dose of autologous Tris-CAR-T cells delivery via Ommaya reservoir. The second 2 patients will be assigned to high dose group, and will have one dose of autologous Tris-CAR-T cells delivery via Ommaya reservoir.

33045721|NCT04119024|This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of modified immune cells (IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells) after a chemotherapy conditioning regimen for the treatment of patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma. The study agent is called IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells. T cells are a special type of white blood cell (immune cells) that have the ability to kill tumor cells. The T cells are obtained from the patients own blood, grown in a laboratory, and modified by adding the IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene. The IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene is inserted into T cells with a virus called a lentivirus. The lentivirus allows cells to make the IL13Ralpha2 CAR protein. This CAR has been designed to bind to a protein on the surface of tumor cells called IL13Ralpha2. This study is being done to determine the dose at which the gene-modified immune cells are safe, how long the cells stay in the body, and if the cells are able to attack the cancer.

33211676|NCT05302037|"CAR-T is a pioneering cancer treatment which has found success in some cancers. This treatment is made first by taking blood cells from the patient. Then in the lab, an artificial protein - a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR), is grafted on the surface of immune cells. The modified cells, which are readministered to the patient, have enhanced abilities to target and destroy cancers than unmodified immune cells.~Currently approved CAR-T can only be used autologously. i.e. the patient will receive CAR-T treatment made from their own cells. This is because current CAR-T treatment uses αβ T cells - a type of immune cell which are largely non-transferable between individual human beings due to the high risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease. However, autologous CAR-T comes with many limitations. A lengthy, manufacturing process follows after the patient donates their own blood, accompanied by a high risk of manufacturing failure, which can be attributed to the cell quality from cancer patients undergoing stressful anti-cancer therapy.~CytoMed Therapeutics pioneers a new CAR-T treatment (CTM-N2D) which may confer some benefit over current CAR-T treatment. CTM-N2D uses a subtype of immune cell -- γδ T cell. Secondly, the CAR on CTM-N2D targets a surface antigen called NKG2DL which are commonly present in many cancer. These two features may confer a safer product profile, of better quality and may be efficacious in cancers where previous CAR-T treatments has not.~The phase I clinical trial of CTM-N2D will be conducted at the National University Hospital, Singapore. The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the optimal dose of CTM-N2D, and to investigate its safety and tolerability.

32850891|NCT05190653|"Research has shown that early palliative care in cancer care is associated with improved symptom management, better prognostic understanding, improved quality of life for patients and family caregivers, and even improved survival. Yet, in spite of the proven benefits of integration of palliative care in oncology, it has been well established that patients with hematologic malignancies and those undergoing cellular therapy (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy) do not routinely receive palliative care. Most of the published research on the early integration of palliative care in oncology describes studies that have involved patients with solid tumours. To date, only one randomized trial examining the impact of integrated palliative care among patients undergoing HSCT has been published and there have been no studies examining the impact of integrated palliative care for patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends early palliative care for patients with advanced cancers or for those with high symptom burden. Patients with blood cancers experience high symptom burden and in the last 30 days of life, compared to patients with solid tumours, patients with blood cancers are more likely to die in hospital, have more intensive care unit admissions, have prolonged hospitalizations (>14 days), and pass away in an acute care facility. There is an urgent need to proactively address suffering throughout cellular therapy trajectories, even before treatment starts, so that patients and caregivers are not inevitably waiting for symptoms to arise before they can be addressed and to optimize quality of life for patients undergoing transplant as well as their family caregivers.~PALS_CT will compare early palliative care to standard care for patients and their family caregivers undergoing HSCT or CAR T-cell therapy for blood cancers."

33126146|NCT01192464|"The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins the protect the body from diseases caused by germs or toxic substances. They work by binding those germs or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers: they both have been shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. This study combines the two methods.~We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. We now want to see if we can attach a new gene to T cells that will help them do a better job at recognizing and killing lymphoma cells.~The new gene we will put in T cells makes an antibody called anti-CD30. The antibody alone has not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric receptor-T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.~We have found that T cells that are also trained to recognize the EBV virus (that causes infectious mononucleosis) can stay in the blood stream for many years. These are called EBV specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes.~By joining the anti-CD30 antibody to the EBV CTLs, we believe that we will also be able to make a cell that can last a long time in the body and recognize and kill lymphoma cells. We call the final cells CD30 chimeric receptor EBV CTLs. T~We hope that these new cells may be able to work longer and target and kill lymphoma cells. However, we do not know that yet."

The study will contain the following sequential phases: screening, lymphocyte apheresis, induction and consolidation chemotherapies combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Once in complete response, patients will receive four cycles of ssCART-19s, namely one cycle of ssCART-19 infusion followed by another three cycles of ssCART-19 and FTC infusion. The role of FTCs is to mimic leukemia cells. Therefore, they are expected to stimulate in vivo expansion and persistence of ssCART-19. Considering the limited number of lymphocytes obtained by a single apheresis from patients and cost-efficacy, in addition to safety, we will explore the range of biologically active doses of FTCs in a phase I study. Based on preclinical data, FTCs stimulation of ssCART-19 at a ratio of 1:1 could achieve the best activation response, so 5×106/kg dosage of FTCs was set as the initial dosage in the study, and lower dose was also evaluated. In this study, FTCs will be administered at the dose of 5×106/kg, 3.25×106/kg or 2×106/kg two hours after ssCART-19 infusion on day 1 and once again administered at the same dose on day 8. After ssCART-19 and FTCs infusion, efficacy will be assessed by detecting molecular response for 6 months, PFS and OS will be followed up for 2 years. In phase II, we will expand the study at optimal biological doses of FTCs, and further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the innovative combination therapy of CD19 CAR-T and FTCs.

33213111|NCT05633615|This phase II trial tests whether mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin helps benefit patients who have received chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) followed by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or lisocabtagene maraleucel) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory) or grade IIIb follicular lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin after chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy may be more effective at controlling or shrinking the cancer than not giving them.

32852467|NCT01593696|"Background:~- Although progress has been made in treating children with B-cell cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, many children do not respond to the standard treatments. One possible treatment involves collecting white blood cells called T cells from the person with cancer and modifying the cells to attack the B-cell cancer. The cells can then be given back to the participant. This study will use T cells that have been modified to attack the cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) protein, which is found on the surface of some B-cell cancers.~Objectives:~- To see if anti-CD19 modified white blood cells are a safe and effective treatment for children and young adults with advanced B-cell cancer.~Eligibility:~Children and young adults between 1 and 30 years of age who have B-cell cancer (leukemia or lymphoma) that has not responded to standard treatments.~The leukemia or the lymphoma must have the CD19 protein.~There must be adequate organ function.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies or bone marrow biopsies may be performed depending on the type of cancer.~Participants will undergo a process where white blood cells are collected, called apheresis. These cells will be modified to contain the anti-CD19 gene.~Participants will have 3 days of chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept the modified cells.~Participants will receive an infusion of their own modified white blood cells. They will remain in the hospital until they have recovered from the treatment.~Participants will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the treatment.~If the participant benefits from the treatment, then he/she may have the option for another round of treatment."

33213362|NCT02442297|"This study is for patients that have brain cancer. The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting immune cells present in the blood that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2). This antibody sticks to tumor cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called HER2. Many types of brain tumors are positive for HER2 . HER2 antibodies have been used to treat people with HER2-positive cancers. For this study, the HER2 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). These CAR-T cells seem to be able to kill tumors like the one these patients have, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited. Therefore, developing ways to prolong the life of these T cells should help them fight cancer.~These HER2-CAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.~The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of HER2-CAR T cells, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this experimental intervention might help patients with brain tumors who volunteer to test this new agent."

No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease, antibodies and immune cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacteria and other diseases. Immune cells, also called lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Both antibodies and lymphocytes have been used to treat patients with cancer. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma and leukemia. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the NKT cells, a special type of lymphocytes that can kill tumor cells but not very effectively on their own. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. Investigators have also found that NKT cells work better if proteins are added that stimulate lymphocytes, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells last for a longer time in the body but maybe not long enough for them to be able to kill the lymphoma cells. It is believed that by adding an extra stimulating protein, called IL-15, the cells will have an even better chance of killing the lymphoma cells.~In this study the investigators are going to see if this is true by putting the anti-CD19 chimeric receptor with CD28 and the IL-15 into NKT cells grown from a healthy individual. These cells are called ANCHOR cells. These cells will be infused into patients that have lymphomas or leukemias that have CD19 on their surface. The ANCHOR cells are investigational products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.~The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of ANCHOR cells that is safe, to see how long the ANCHOR cells last, to learn what their side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help people with lymphoma or leukemia."

33131446|NCT03605238|CAR-T therapy was proposed and has been recently used for cancer treatment. It has been hailed for its promising remission rates after early stage clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, CAR-T therapy is seldom used for autoimmune diseases. Researchers only use it for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), that include the neuromyelitis optica (NMO), are a group of inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system characterized by episodes of immune-mediated demyelination and axonal damage mainly involving optic nerves and spinal cord. NMO is characterized by the presence of an anti-Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody, which can only be produced by differentiation of B cells to plasma cells. Because these anti-AQP4 antibodies may be pathogenic, B cells recognizing AQP4 may be directly involved in the disease process as well. B cells also play a role as potent antigen presenting cells in NMO. NMO has the characteristics of high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. In the conventional treatment options, NMOSD could be treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs immunosuppressant (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab). But these drugs could barely completely cure NMOSD. And now, chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell infusion maybe an effective treatment to solve these problems. The rationale for using CAR-T therapy in NMOSD is based on the known roles of B cells, antibody production and plasma cells in the pathophysiology of NMOSD. The strongest evidence of the importance of B cells in NMO comes from studies of B cell depletion, most commonly with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab. Emerging evidence indicates that peripheral B cells are activated during a relapse and plasmablast production of anti-AQP4 antibodies spikes. The investigators infuse tanCART19/20 to completely deplete B cells. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of this tanCART19/20 in the treatment of NMOSD.

33058246|NCT05377827|"Effective treatment options for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) represent a significant unmet medical need. CAR T therapy has offered durable remissions and potential cures in some forms of hematologic malignancy, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In AML, however, CAR T approaches have been limited by the lack of suitable antigens, as most myeloid markers are shared with normal hematopoietic stem cells and targeting of these antigens by CAR T therapy leads to undesirable hematologic toxicity. Similarly, T-NHL has not yet benefited from CAR T therapy due to a lack of suitable markers. One potential therapeutic target is CD7, which is expressed normally on mature T-cells and NK-cells but is also aberrantly expressed on ~30% of acute myeloid leukemias. CAR T therapy for patients with CD7+ AML and T-NHL will potentially offer a new therapeutic option which has a chance of offering durable benefit.~WU-CART-007 is a CD7-directed, genetically modified, allogeneic, fratricide-resistant chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product for the treatment of CD7+ hematologic malignancies. These cells have two key changes from conventional, autologous CAR T-cells. First, because CD7 is present on normal T-cells including conventional CAR T products, CD7 is deleted from WU CART-007. This allows for targeting of CD7 without the risk of fratricide (killing of WU-CART-007 cells by other WU-CART-007 cells). Second, the T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) is also deleted. This makes WU CART 007 cells incapable of recognizing antigens other than CD7 and allows for the use of an allogeneic product without causing Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD)."

Cellular immunotherapy (IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells) are brain-tumor specific cells that may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Many patients with brain tumor respond to treatment, but then the tumor starts to grow again.

33137297|NCT00881920|"Patients have a type of cancer called NHL, Multiple Myeloma (MM) or CLL that has come back or has not gone away after treatment. There is no standard treatment for the cancer at this time or the currently used treatments do not work completely in all cases like these. This is a gene transfer research study using special immune cells.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease, antibodies and T cells, that investigators hope will work together. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~The antibody used in this study recognizes a protein on the lymphoma, MM or CLL cells called kappa immunoglobulin. Antibodies can stick to lymphoma, MM or CLL cells when it recognizes the kappa molecules present on the tumor cells. For this study, the kappa antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric receptor-T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited.~In the laboratory, investigators found that T cells work better if they also add a protein that stimulates T cells to grow called CD28. By joining the anti-kappa antibody to the T cells and adding the CD28, the investigators expect to be able to make cells that will last for a longer time in the body (because of the presence of the CD28). They are hoping this will make the cells work better.~Previously, when patients enrolled on this study, they were assigned to one of three different doses of the kappa-CD28 T cells. We found that all three dose levels are safe. Now, the plan is to give patients the highest dose that we tested.~These chimeric T cells (kappa-CD28) are an investigational product not approved by the FDA."

Placing genes added in the laboratory into immune T-cells may make the T-cells recognize BCMA, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. JSMD194 may enhance the killing of cancer cells by increasing the BCMA expression on multiple myeloma cells, making the targeted BCMA CAR-T treatment more effective. JSMD194 also decreases the amount of BCMA found in the circulation (called soluble BCMA) that is not bound to the myeloma cells. JSMD194 can therefore reduce the potential for soluble BCMA to act as a decoy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving BCMA CAR T therapy with JSMD194, cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine may work better in treating participants with relapsed or persistent multiple myeloma.

32860685|NCT01087294|"Background:~Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is a procedure that transplants bone marrow cells (stem cells) from a matching donor into a recipient in order to allow the donor stem cells to produce cells that will attack the recipient s cancer cells. AlloHSCT is performed when chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy do not adequately control cancer growth. However, cancers that are not controlled by alloHSCT frequently become resistant to other standard treatment options.~The outcomes of alloHSCT might be improved if certain kinds of white blood cells (T cells) could be manipulated so that they generate a more potent effect against the cancer cells. This effect can be augmented by genetically engineering donor T cells to specifically recognize cancerous cells in order to attack them. For this purpose, researchers are studying a specific kind of genetically engineered T cell known as the anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell. More research is needed to determine if this T cell will be an effective treatment for certain kinds of B cell cancer (such as non-Hodgkin s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) that has not been controlled with alloHSCT.~Objectives:~- To assess the safety and effectiveness of administering allogeneic anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells to patients with B-cell cancer that has not responded to alloHSCT.~Eligibility:~Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for a B cell cancer, but whose cancer has either not responded to or recurred after the transplant.~Recipients must have the same stem cell donor from their previous procedure.~Design:~Before the start of the study, all participants will be screened with a medical history and blood tests. Recipients will have tumor imaging scans, additional blood tests, and other tests as directed by the study doctors.~Donor participants will undergo apheresis to provide white blood cells for researchers to use in the treatment.~Recipients will have dose escalation to determine the most effective yet safe dose of anti-CD19 T cells.

Patients may be considered if the cancer has come back, has not gone away after standard treatment or the patient cannot receive standard treatment. This research study uses special immune system cells called GAP T cells, a new experimental treatment.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In preclinical studies, the investigators made several genes called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GC33 that recognizes glypican-3, a proteoglycan found on solid tumors including pediatric liver cancers (GPC3-CAR). This study will test T cells genetically engineered with a GPC3-CAR (GAP T cells) in patients with GPC3-positive solid tumors (currently only enrolling liver tumors).~The GAP T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.~The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of GAP T cells that is safe, to see how long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the GAP T cells will help people with GPC3-positive solid tumors.

32953781|NCT04516551|The patients with relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) have a poor prognosis, especially for these relapsed in a short time after transplantation. Nowadays there is no effective way to salvage patients in such conditions. T cells derived from healthy matched sibling or unrelated donors have not been restrained by tumor micro-environment and retain anti-leukemia ability, which makes it serve well for patients with relapsed B-ALL. So we launched a multi-center clinical trial to proved the safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells for relapsed B cell ALL.
32953809|NCT04324996|"SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly leads to interstitial pneumonia. The patients with low immunity have more serious conditions. At present, there is no specific drug/therapy available for COVID-19. NK cells are the major cells of the natural immune system, which are essential for innate immunity and adaptive immunity, and are indispensable in the defense of virus infection. NKG2D is an activating receptor of NK cells, which can recognize and thus clear virus infected cells. NK cells modified by CAR play a role in targeted cell therapy, and have benn demonstrated very safe without severe side effects such as cytokine releasing syndromes. The survival time of NK cells will be very short if there is no IL-15-sustained support after adoptive transfer into the body. In comparison with natural IL-15 in vivo, IL-15 superagonist (sIL-15/IL-15Rɑ chimeric protein) has increased the activity by nearly 20 times and as well as improved pharmacokinetic characteristics with longer persistence and enhanced target cytotoxicity. CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have been shown to be abrogated through GM-CSF neutralization. ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and binds to S protein of the virus envelope. We have constructed and prepared the universal off-the-shelf IL15 superagonist- and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv-secreting NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK derived from cord blood. By targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE2 and NKG2D, respectively, and with the strong synergistic effect of IL15 superagonist and CRS prevention through GM-CSF neutralizing scFv, we hope that the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and their infected cells can be safely and effectively removed, thus providing a safe and effective cell therapy for COVID-19. In addition, ACE2 CAR-NK cells can competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells and other important organ or tissue cells through ACE2 so as to make SARS-CoV-2 abortive infection (i.e., no production of infectious virus particles).~This project is an open, randomized, parallel, multicenter phase I/II clinical trial. The NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells secreting super IL15 superagonist and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv are going to be give by intravenous infusion (108 cells per kilogram of body weight, once a week) for the treatment of 30 patients with each common, severe and critical type COVID-19, respectively."

33143975|NCT05150522|For the treatment of relapsed and refractory MM, the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Multiple Myeloma pointed out that relapsed MM is highly heterogeneous, and individualized evaluation of relapsed patients is required to determine the treatment time. Patients with biochemical recurrence with only elevated M protein do not need immediate treatment, only regular follow-up visits. For patients with CRAB manifestations or rapid biochemical relapse, treatment needs to be initiated immediately. Patients who relapse within 6 months can switch to a drug combination with other mechanisms of action; patients who relapse within 6 to 12 months should first switch to a drug combination with other mechanisms of action, or they can be retreated with the original drug; 12 months Patients with the above recurrence can use the original regimen to re-induction therapy, or switch to a drug regimen with other mechanisms of action. Bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide are currently the key drugs for the treatment of relapsed MM in China. Patients with suitable conditions should undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, while allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is rarely used because of higher transplant-related mortality.

This study plans to recruit a total of about 10-16 adult patients with CD19 positive recurrent or refractory DLBCL for a single autologous car-t cell therapy. There are three dose groups in the study. The first dose group has one patient. If there is no dose limiting toxicity (DLT), it can be increased to the second dose group, otherwise it will continue to be enrolled according to the 3 + 3 method; The follow-up dose group is conducted according to the traditional 3 + 3 design, that is, three subjects are first enrolled in a dose group. If there is no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the three patients in the dose group, it can be increased to the next higher dose after completing the DLT observation period; If DLT occurs in 1 of the 3 patients in the dose group, it is necessary to continue to enroll 3 patients in the dose group for DLT observation. The highest dose level of DLT in less than or equal to 1 of the last 6 confirmed patients will be defined as MTD. The safety of car-t treatment was evaluated by observing the adverse events after cell therapy; Evaluate the effectiveness of car-t treatment compared with the results or historical data of the patient's own previous standard treatment regimen. Blood and bone marrow were collected before and 12 months after cell infusion, the number and activity of car-t cells were detected, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of car-t cells was evaluated."

32867090|NCT05052528|"This phase I trial evaluates the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without rituximab before CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). T-cells are a normal part of the immune system. To make the T-cell medication, T-cells are taken from the blood and altered in a laboratory. They are then returned to the body. The altered T-cells will latch on to a specific part of the cancer cells and hopefully kill them. Once the T-cells have been altered in the laboratory, they are called CAR T-cells. CAR is short for chimeric antigen receptors. These are structures on the surface of cells that allow the altered T-Cells to find and destroy the cancer cells. Another part of the T-Cell medication is called CD19. This part is called a biomarker. Biomarkers help doctors determine whether a cancer is getting worse and whether medications are working to stop it. The chemotherapy drugs that are given before the T-Cell therapy are cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and rituximab. Rituximab is an immunotherapy drug. These chemotherapy drugs will reduce the number of normal (unaltered) T-Cells in the body to make room for the altered T-cells to kill the cancer cells. Giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without rituximab before CD19 CAR T cell therapy may help improve response to CD19 CAR T cell therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."

33149611|NCT03463928|Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) is routinely used for treatment of aggressive hematological malignancies. The biological foundation of allo-HSCT is the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which is primarily mediated by donor T cells present in the graft and is able to eradicate malignant B cells either CD19+ or CD19-. Relapse following an allo-HSCT remains a major challenge in the treatment of B-ALL. CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies; however, a subset of patients relapse due to the loss of CD19 in tumor cells. Co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells and donor-derived-HSCT has the potential to combine the CAR-T cell mediated targeted elimination of CD19 expressing B cells with GVL effect, which could have clear advantages in reducing the risk of relapse and the evolution of CD19- escape variants or clonally related malignancies in other lineages. Therefore, a complete and durable tumor responses induced by this immunotherapy could be expected.

33234689|NCT05240950|Recurrence of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer after R0 resection is mainly due to the invisible minimal residual disease, which are the main factors leading to metastasis and recurrence. Positive circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the direct evidence of the minimal residual disease (MRD). In recent years, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy (CAR-T) has made great breakthroughs, and has achieved good therapeutic effects in hematological tumors, but the research on solid tumors is limited. CEA expression is generally elevated in gastrointestinal tumors and is associated with high aggressiveness of tumors. At present, solid tumor cell therapy targeting CEA has been carried out at home and abroad, and has achieved certain efficacy. Anti-CEA CAR-T cells targeting CEA have been constructed in the pre-clinical study of this project, and the pre-clinical study results suggest good safety and effectiveness. Formation of minimal residual disease is associated with circulating blood in the residual tumor cells. Using this feature, this project intends to conduct a phase I clinical study on patients with minimal residual disease /positive ctDNA after R0 resection of colorectal cancer liver metastasis, so as to conduct preliminary exploration of anti-CEA CAR-T cell therapy, evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the therapy, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and provide guidance for subsequent drug dosage and clinical trials.

32776972|NCT03696784|"This research study combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The treatment being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.~Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.~Preliminary results have shown that subjects receiving this treatment have experienced unwanted side effects including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. In this study, to help reduce cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity symptoms, the ATLCAR.CD19 cells have a safety switch that, when active, can cause the cells to become dormant. These modified ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells. If the subject experiences moderate to severe cytokine release syndrome and or neurotoxicity as a result of being given iC9-CAR19 cells, the subject can be given a dose of a second study drug, AP1903, if standard interventions fail to alleviate the symptoms of cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity. AP1903 activates the iC9-CAR19 safety switch, reducing the number of the iC9-CAR19 cells in the blood. The ultimate goal is to determine what dose of AP1903 can be given that reduces the severity of the cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity, but still allows the remaining iC9-CAR19 cells to effectively fight the lymphoma.~The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving iC9-CAR19 cells is safe and tolerable in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)."

32960907|NCT04099797|"This study is for patients with diffuse midline glioma, high grade glioma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, medulloblastoma, or another rare brain cancer that expresses GD2. Because there is no standard treatment at this time, patients are asked to volunteer in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells called T cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that help the body fight infection.~This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat cancer patients. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~Researchers have found from previous research that they can put a new antibody gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. GD2 is a protein found on several different cancers. Researchers testing brain cancer cells found that many of these cancers also have GD2 on their surface.~In a study for neuroblastoma in children, a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) was made from an antibody that recognizes GD2. This gene was put into the patients' own T cells and given back to 11 patients. The cells did grow for a while but started to disappear from the blood after 2 weeks. The researchers think that if T cells are able to last longer they may have a better chance of killing tumor cells.~In this study, a new gene will be added to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells to live longer. T cells need substances called cytokines to survive. The gene C7R has been added that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a longer period of time.~In other studies using T cells researchers found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and it will allow the T cells to expand and stay longer in the body and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.~After treating 11 patients, the largest safe dose of GD2-CAR T cells given in the vein (IV) was determined. Going forward, IV infusions will be combined with infusions directly into the brain through the Ommaya reservoir or programmable VP shunt. The goal is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-C7R T cells that can be administered in this way.~The GD2.C7R T cells are an investigational product not approved by the FDA."
32960913|NCT04013802|"The purpose of this study is to use VSTs (virus-specific T cells) from a donor that is a partial HLA (human leukocyte antigen) match with the patient to treat viral infections after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). These cells may also have value in CAR-T recipients who have received a product that depletes virus specific T cells.~The patient must have had a myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT using either bone marrow, single/double umbilical cord blood, or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or CAR T cell product targeting an antigen expressed on virus specific T cells. After a transplant, while the immune system grows back, the patient is at risk for infection. Some viruses can stay in the body for life and are normally controlled by a healthy immune system, but if the immune system is weakened, like after a transplant, they can cause life threatening infections. He/she must have had an infection with one or more of the following viruses -Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (AdV), Human polyomavirus type I (BKV), and human polyomavirus type II (JCV)- that has persisted or recurred despite standard therapy.~In this study, the investigators want to use white blood cells that have been trained to treat viral infections. In an earlier study the investigators showed that treatment with such specially trained T cells has been successful when the cells are made from the transplant donor. However as it takes 1-2 months to make the cells, that approach is not practical for patients who already have an infection. In a subsequent study, the investigators were able to create multivirus-specific T cells (VSTs) from the blood of healthy donors and created a bank of these cells. The investigators then successfully used these banked cells to treat virus infections after a stem cell transplant.

Some patients with lymphoma have EBV in their cancer cells. Researchers have given T cell lines from normal donor EBVSTs to lymphoma patients who have EBV in their lymphoma cells and have seen responses in about half the patients. The cells have have been generated and are frozen in a bank. The cells are called allogeneic (meaning the donor is not related to the patient). CD30.CAR in EBV-specific T cells (called allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST) from the blood of healthy donors. The investigators are giving the cells to patients with lymphoma cells that express CD30. If the lymphoma cells also express EBV there may be some benefit from targeting both proteins.~The purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose of allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST cells given following chemotherapy and used to treat lymphoma. The investigators will learn the side effects of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in patients and see whether this therapy may help lymphoma patients."

33157803|NCT03473496|Multiple myeloma（MM） is one of the most common malignant diseases in the blood system.There is still no cure for the disease which only control the development of the disease in various ways.Chimeric Antigen Receptor-transduced T cell (CAR-T) therapy is one of revolutionary targeted immunotherapy.The efficacy of CAR-T cells for the treatment of acute B lymphocytic leukemia has been widely recognized, and several clinical trials have been reported in the treatment of multiple myeloma with CAR-T cells.
33072891|NCT05631912|The team has developed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) based on T cell receptor (TCR) complex, called synthetic TCR and antigen receptor (STAR). Further, the researchers disrupted the endogenous T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus by CRISPR/cas9, and then knocked in the anti-CD19-STAR construct through TRAC endogenous promoter. In this single center, prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase 1/2 study, the safety and efficacy of autologous CD19-targeting STAR-T cell therapy will be evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) . A total of 19 to 38 patients are planned to be enrolled and receive CD19-STAR-T cell infusion. Phase 1 (9 to 18 cases) is dose escalation part, and phase 2 (10 to 20 cases) is expansion cohort part.
32961357|NCT04639739|Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. There are limitations of CAR-T cells, the consuming manufacturing time and expensive price exclude the majority of patients. therefore, we designed this trial to manifest the safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR NK cell therapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
32778371|NCT03030976|CAR-T therapy was therefore proposed and has been recently used for cancer treatment. It has been hailed for its promising remission rates after early stage clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, CAR-T therapy is seldom used for autoimmune diseases. Researchers only use it for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS, an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system). SLE is a kind of autoimmune diseases which involving multiple systems, organs and with the present of a variety of autoantibodies. In the conventional treatment options, SLE could be treated with chemotherapy drugs or hormone drugs. But chemotherapy and hormone drugs could barely cured SLE. And now, chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell infusion maybe an effective treatment to solve these problems. The investigators use a 2nd CAR- T with the optimized hinge and transmembrane domain to treat patients with SLE. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of this 2nd CAR-T cells in the treatment of SLE.
33073013|NCT05397184|T-cell leukaemia is an uncommon type of blood cell cancer that affects white blood cells (T cells). This phase I clinical trial will treat children aged 6 months up to 16 years with T cell leukaemia which has come back (relapsed) after chemotherapy or is not responding to chemotherapy (refractory). The cell therapy is made from white blood cells (T cells) collected from a healthy donor and changed so they can kill other T cells, including leukaemia cells. These 'ready-made' CAR T cells have been made using a new technique called CRISPR base editing to modify them DNA code and have been given the name BE CAR-7. This technique allows them to work after chemotherapy and also disarms them to prevent effects against normal cells. The main aim of this study is to assess the safety of the BE CAR-7 treatment and to see if ready-made CAR T cells can eradicate T cell leukaemia ahead of a planned bone marrow transplant.

32779154|NCT03602157|"The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way is perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with bacteria or viruses. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to treat cancer. This study will combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective treatment called Autologous T Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30). Another treatment being tested includes the Autologous T Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen with CCR4 (ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4) to help the cells move to regions in the patient's body where the cancer is present. Participants in this study will receive either ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells alone or will receive ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells combined with ATLCAR.CD30 cells.~Previous studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells (ATLCAR.CD30) can kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.~Researchers are working to identify ways to improve the ability of ATLCAR.CD30 to destroy tumor cells. T cells naturally produce a protein called CCR4 which functions as a navigation system directing T cells toward tumor cells specifically. In this study, researchers will also genetically modify ATLCAR.CD30 cells to produce more CCR4 proteins and they will be called ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4. The study team believes that the ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells will be guided directly toward the tumor cells based on their navigation system. In addition, the study team believes the majority of ATLCAR.CD30 cells will also be guided directly toward tumor cells when given together with ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4, increasing their anti-cancer fighting ability.~This is the first time ATLCAR>CD30.CCR4 cells or combination of ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 and ATLCAR.CD30 cells are used to treat lymphoma. The purpose of this study to determine the following:~What is the safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells to give to patients~What is the safe dose of the combination of ATLCAR.CD30 and ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells to give to patients"

33160865|NCT02439788|"This research study is for patients that have a cancer called Neuroblastoma that has either come back after treatment or did not respond to the standard medicines used to treat it. This study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and Natural Killer T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. The investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In a previous clinical trial, the investigators made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called 14g2a that recognizes GD2, a molecule found on almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). They put this gene into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to patients that had neuroblastoma. Nineteen patients were treated on that study and there were no long term side-effects seen after the GD2 T cell infusion. As the investigators have followed the patients over time, they noticed that for those patients with disease at the time of their infusion, the time to progression (the amount of time it takes before their neuroblastoma got worse) was longer in those whom they could find GD2 T cells in the blood for more than 6 weeks after the last T cell infusion. Because of this, the investigators think that if effector cells are able to last longer, they may have a better chance of killing neuroblastoma tumor cells.~Natural Killer T cells are a special subset of innate lymphocytes that can effectively go into tumor tissues of neuroblastoma. Inside the tumor, there are certain white blood cells which help the cancer cells to grow and recover from injury. Natural Killer T-cells can specifically kill these cells. In this study, Natural Killer T cells will be genetically engineered to express GD2-CAR to attack neuroblastoma cells and the white blood cells inside the tumor tissue."

32964315|NCT02903810|Clinical study of CD19 CAR-T in the treatment of blood and lymphatic system tumor has been achieved a breakthrough. The main solution in clinical research is to use CD19 CAR-T infusion alone. Because of the heterogeneity of the tumor, the patient often carries tumor cells with CD19 deficient but other positive target antigens (such as CD22). Specifically removal of CD19 positive tumor cells in CAR-T treatment, CD19 negative tumor cells or tumor cells which carry other target antigens would amplify with extra free space released at the same time, resulting in the relapse of tumors of heterogeneities. In order to effectively control the recurrence, CAR-T treatment scheme specific for several target antigens was presented and verified. However treatment with the sequential infusion of different target specific CAR-T cells, the window period between two times infusions may be the opportunity for the tumor recurrence of heterogeneity; and bispecific CAR-T has also been reported only one CAR can be fully functioned. In order to avoid these problems, this topic puts forward for the first time in the international with a treatment scheme of an equal amount of infusion of CD19-41BB and CD22-41BB two Car-T in the treatment of refractory hematologic malignancies. We expect the treatment is more effective in eliminating tumor burden, and also can inhibit the recurrence of tumor heterogeneity at the same time.

32788569|NCT03166878|"Autologous T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) against leukemia antigens such as CD19 on B cells have shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. However, a subset of cancer patients especially heavily pretreated cancer patients could be unable to receive this highly active therapy because of failed expansion. Moreover, it is still a challenge to manufacture an effective therapeutic product for infant cancer patients due to their small blood volume. On the other hand, the inherent characters of autologous CAR-T cell therapy including personalized autologous T cell manufacturing and widely distributed approach result in the difficulty of industrialization of autologous CAR-T cell therapy. Universal CD19-specific CAR-T cell(UCART019),derived from one or more healthy unrelated donors but could avoid graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and minimize their immunogenicity, is undoubtedly an alternative option to address above-mentioned issues. We have generated gene-disrupted allogeneic CD19-directed BBζ CAR-T cells (termed UCART019) by combining the lentiviral delivery of CAR and CRISPR RNA electroporation to disrupt endogenous TCR and B2M genes simultaneously and will test whether it can evade host-mediated immunity and deliver antileukemic effects without GVHD.~The main goal of the phase 1 portion of this phase 1/2 trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of several doses of UCART019 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma, so as to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of UCART019 for phase 2 portion.

32792661|NCT04007029|This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CD19/CD20 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells when given together with chemotherapy, and to see how effective they are in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). In CAR-T cell therapy, a patient's white blood cells (T cells) are changed in the laboratory to produce an engineered receptor that allows the T cell to recognize and respond to CD19 and CD20 proteins. CD19 and CD20 are commonly found on non-Hodgkin?s B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide can control cancer cells by killing them, by preventing their growth, or by stopping them from spreading. Combining CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells and chemotherapy may help treat patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

33168978|NCT03618381|This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study that will enroll pediatric and young adult research participants with relapsed or refractory non-CNS solid tumors to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of administering T cell products derived from the research participant's blood that have been genetically modified to express a EGFR-specific receptor (chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR) that will target and kill solid tumors that express EGFR and the selection-suicide marker EGFRt. EGFRt is a protein incorporated into the cell with our EGFR receptor which is used to identify the modified T cells and can be used as a tag that allows for elimination of the modified T cells if needed. On Arm A of the study, research participants will receive EGFR-specific CAR T cells only. On Arm B of the study, research participants will receive CAR T cells directed at EGFR and CD19, a marker on the surface of B lymphocytes, following the hypothesis that CD19+ B cells serving in their normal role as antigen presenting cells to T cells will promote the expansion and persistence of the CAR T cells. The CD19 receptor harbors a different selection-suicide marker, HERtG. The primary objectives of the study will be to determine the feasibility of manufacturing the cell products, the safety of the T cell product infusion, to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the CAR T cells products, to describe the full toxicity profile of each product, and determine the persistence of the modified cell in the subject's body on each arm. Subjects will receive a single dose of T cells comprised of two different subtypes of T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells) felt to benefit one another once administered to the research participants for improved potential therapeutic effect. The secondary objectives of this protocol are to study the number of modified cells in the patients and the duration they continue to be at detectable levels. The investigators will also quantitate anti-tumor efficacy on each arm. Subjects who experience significant and potentially life-threatening toxicities (other than clinically manageable toxicities related to T cells working, called cytokine release syndrome) will receive infusions of cetuximab (an antibody commercially available that targets EGFRt) or trastuzumab (an antibody commercially available that targets HER2tG) to assess the ability of the EGFRt on the T cells to be an effective suicide mechanism for the elimination of the transferred T cell products.

32796554|NCT05310591|"Tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) is an anti-CD19 autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which has shown dramatic early results in advanced ALLs. Early loss of B-cell aplasia (recovery of B-cells in marrow/ peripheral blood within 6 months after infusion), a marker of the loss or non-functionality of the CAR T-cells, is associated to a very high risk of relapse. A reinfusion of CTL019, even after Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide reconditioning, frequently fails to induce further expansion as observed in UPENN studies and in the Robert Debré Hospital experience.~Non-persistence of CAR T-cells may be due to immune- mediated rejection or environment-mediated suppression of their growth. Evidence for increased PD-1 expression in CAR T-cells between infusion and peak expansion has been demonstrated in clinical samples.~Preclinical data and few clinical data support a role of PD- 1-PD-L1 blockade in improving the effectiveness of CAR T-cell therapy.~The objectives of this phase I/II study is to determine the safety, efficacy and feasibility of Nivolumab (Opdivo®)- an anti-PD1 treatment- combined to tisagenlecleucel in a cohort of relapsed or refractory B-ALL patients, aged 1-25 years old, previously treated by tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®), with a demonstrated early loss of B-cell aplasia (within 6 months), a surrogate marker of the loss of CAR T-cells or their non- functionality.~More specifically, the main objectives are:~• In cohort 1 that includes patients with a MRD negative disease status combined to an early loss (within 6 months) of B-cell aplasia :~To determine the optimal starting time of Nivolumab (Opdivo®) in terms of safety and efficacy among 4 candidate time points (day 14, day 11, day 5, and day - 1).~• In cohort 2 that includes relapsed patients with an early loss (within 6 months) of B-cell aplasia :~To estimate the feasibility in terms of safety and efficacy of a very early start of nivolumab (day-1), prior to the reinfusion of tisagenlecleucel"

33171705|NCT03321123|Precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in childhood. Despite major advances in ALL therapy, 20% of children and 40-50% of adults fail state-of-the art first-line treatment. But there is a strong need for alternative treatments to cure chemotherapy-refractory and relapsed B cell malignancies in pediatric patients. Relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies remain a therapeutic challenge, as these diseases are characterized by adverse survival. These cancers share a cell origin from the B-cell lineage and consequent surface expression of B-lineage markers such as CD19 and CD22. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cell therapy has recently emerged as a new modality to target B cell malignancies. CARs couple a single-chain Fv (scFv) domain directed against a B-lineage-specific antigen to T-cell activating intracellular signaling domains. CAR gene-modified T cell interaction with target cells occurs in a HLA-independent fashion, so that a single vector can be used to treat all patients with cancers that express the target antigen. Miltenyi Biotec has established a semi-automated manufacturing process that can be made available to academic settings for systematic exploration of CAR strategies in advanced clinical studies. Closed-system operation, improved robustness, simplified work flows, and reduced labor intensity, while maintaining strict adherence to regulatory guidelines, allows for decentralized manufacturing. In the proposed phase II study, the investigator will explore autologous 2nd generation CD19 CAR T cell products in patients with relapsed and refractory disease incurable with standard therapies.

NKTR-255 is an investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer. T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. Lisocabtagene maraleucel is a CAR-T cell product that consists of genetically engineered T cells, modified to recognize CD19, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CD19-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill CD19-positive cancer cells.

Nevertheless, this therapy is frequently associated with cytokine release syndrome and in approximately 20% to 60% of patients with neurological complications that can sometimes be dramatic and are associated with a significant mortality rate.~The mechanisms behind this neurotoxicity are unclear.~Despite the frequent occurrence of neurological toxicity characterized in particular by headache, tremor, and encephalopathy that is most often transient, brain imaging by CT or, preferably, MRI are most often normal. The rare abnormalities that have been identified suggest the presence of cytotoxic edema associated with the existence of transient modifications of the blood-brain barrier.~To date, the management of neurotoxicity associated with CAR-T CELLS remains empirical. It combines early management of cytokine release syndrome (by administration of anti-IL6) and treatment with corticosteroids, the objective of which would be to control neurotoxicity more specifically. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with this neurotoxicity appears essential today in order to be able to propose adapted prevention and treatment methods.~Main objectives are to compare tissue permeability by quantitative MRI measurement of Ktrans to the theoretical peak of neurotoxicity between patients with CAR-T Cell-induced neurotoxicity and those without neurotoxicity and to Study, by MRI, the evolution of tissue microcirculatory parameters (from D-3 to D7) between groups of patients with or without the occurrence of neurotoxicity associated with CAR-T CELL treatment.~For this purpose, 25 subjects will be included (the investigators hypothesize 40% with treatment-induced neurological impairment)."

On Arm A of the study, research participants will receive B7H3-specific CAR T cells only. On Arm B of the study, research participants will receive CAR T cells directed at B7H3 and CD19, a marker on the surface of B lymphocytes, following the hypothesis that CD19+ B cells serving in their normal role as antigen presenting cells to T cells will promote the expansion and persistence of the CAR T cells. Arm A CAR T cells include the protein EGFRt and Arm B CAR T cells include the protein HER2tG. These proteins can be used to both track and destroy the CAR T cells in case of undue toxicity. The primary objectives of the study will be to determine the feasibility of manufacturing the cell products, the safety of the T cell product infusion, to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the CAR T cells products, to describe the full toxicity profile of each product, and determine the persistence of the modified cell in the participant's body on each arm. Participants will receive a single dose of T cells comprised of two different subtypes of T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells) felt to benefit one another once administered to the research participants for improved potential therapeutic effect.

CAR T cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, CD19, on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. ICV is an injection technique that delivers the CD19-CAR T cells directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (which flows in and around the hollow spaces of the brain and spinal cord, and the thin layers of tissue that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord) in the brain, through a surgically placed catheter. Giving CD19-CAR T cells ICV may be more effective at treating patients with primary CNS lymphoma than giving them via other methods.

Although a transplant can cure leukemia or lymphoma, some people will relapse. In those who relapse, current treatment cures only a very small percentage. Although giving patients a dose of donor immune cells before relapse can prevent relapse of the leukemia or lymphoma, DLI can also cause a serious complication called graft versus host disease (GVHD). This is a gene transfer research study using special immune cells which are specific for these cancer cells.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. This study combines 2 of those ways, antibodies and T cells. T cells (CTLs or cytotoxic T cells) are infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but haven't been strong enough to cure most patients.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it's called a chimeric receptor.~In the laboratory, investigators found that T cells that are trained to recognize common viruses can stay in the blood stream for many years. By joining the anti-CD19 antibody to CTLs that recognize viruses, they believe that they will also be able to make a cell that can last a long time in the body, provide protection from viruses, and recognize and kill leukemia. The CTLs which we will join the anti-CD19 antibody to attack 3 viruses (trivirus-specific CTLs), CMV, EBV, and adenovirus.~Studies have shown that trivirus-specific CTLs grown from the stem cell donor can be given safely to transplant recipients and can stop these viruses from causing severe infections. These CD19 chimeric receptor trivirus specific T cells are an investigational product not approved by the FDA.~The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe, to assess the side effects, to see how long the T cells last and to evaluate whether this therapy might help prevent infections and relapse in people with CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma having a SCT."

They now want to see if they can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that the investigators will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition, it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. After this new gene is put into the T cell, the T cell becomes known as a chimeric antigen receptor T cell or CAR T cell.~In another clinical study using these CAR T cells targeting HER2 as well as other studies using CAR T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of the patient's lymphocytes first should allow the infused T cells to expand in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.~The chemotherapy used for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.~After the patient receives the lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T cells during treatment on the study, they will receive an antibody drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab or nivolumab.

Cytokines are small proteins that interreact as e signals to other cells and are the way cells talk to one another. During cytokine release syndrome, too many cytokines are released and too many cells in your body react to their release. Symptoms resulting from cytokine release syndrome vary from flu-like symptoms to more severe side effects such as cardiac arrest, multi-system organ failure or death. We predict that about 50% of patients on this study will experience mild to severe cytokine release syndrome.~To help reduce cytokine release syndrome symptoms in future patients, a safety switch has been added to the ATLCAR.CD19 cells that can cause the cells to become dormant or go to sleep. The safety switch is called inducible caspase 9 or iC9. The modified ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells.~The purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving the iC9-CAR19 cells is safe and tolerable (there are not too many unwanted effects). Researchers has previously tested different doses of the iC9-CAR19. An effective dose that had the least number of unwanted side effects in patients was identified. It was planned to test this dose in more patients to learn more about its effect in the body. This type of research study is called a dose expansion study. It will allow the investigators to collect more information about the effect of this dose in treating of certain type of cancer."

33085611|NCT03690011|"Patients eligible for this study have a type of blood cancer called T-cell lymphoma (lymph gland cancer).~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. This study combines two different ways of fighting disease with antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells, or T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat cancer; they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~T cells can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person.~The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD7. This antibody sticks to T-cell lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD7. CD7 antibodies have been used to treat people with T-cell lymphoma. For this study, anti-CD7 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.~In the laboratory, investigators have also found that T cells work better if they also add proteins that stimulate T cells, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells.~In this study, investigators attach the CD7 chimeric receptor with CD28 added to it to T cells. Investigators will then test how long the cells last. These CD7 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 are investigational products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration."

32980232|NCT04860817|T cells are a type of immune cell. Like other cells of the body, T Cells can develop cancer. T cell cancers mainly include T cell leukaemia and T cell lymphoma, both of which have a relatively poor prognosis. Currently, patients with relapsed/refractory type (the name given to cancer that reappears or grows again after a period of no changes or signs of cancer) of this leukaemia or lymphoma have limited choices for treatment. CAR-T cells are immune cells that are engineered to target specific cell markers. For example, CAR-T cells targeting the marker CD19 have shown great effectiveness in the treatment of B cell tumors that carry this marker. Here investigators construct a new universal CAR-T design targeting CD7 which is found on the cells of relapsed/refractory type T cell leukaemia and lymphoma and hope to test its safety and efficiency in the treatment of relapsed/refractory type T cell leukaemia and lymphoma.

32983893|NCT00902044|Patients have a type of cancer called sarcoma. Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from diseases caused by germs or toxic substances. They work by binding those germs or substances, which stops them from growing or exerting their toxic effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers: they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. We now want to see if we can put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new gene that we will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition it contains CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of patient's lymphocytes first should allow the T cells we infuse to expand and stay longer in your body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively. We will use fludarabine or the combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine as the chemotherapy agents for lymphodepletion. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are the chemotherapy agents most commonly used for lymphodepletion in immunotherapy clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of chimeric T cells, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma. Another purpose is to see if it is safe to give HER2-CD28 T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

32806282|NCT04822974|Torque Teno Virus (TTV) prevalence in the general population is very high (>90%) and has not been consistently confirmed to cause any disease. Kidney transplant studies seem to indicate that an elevated viremia could predict the risk of de-veloping an infectious process in the following weeks. An study of the influence of TTV as a predictive marker of infection in kidney transplant recipi-ents showed higher TTV levels, even 3 months before the infectious process, allowing the authors to postulate that the quantification of TTV could help to modulate the treatment of patients at risk. Publications of subsequent studies seem to confirm these data.In the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) few studies have analyzed the replication kinetics of TTV. There seems to be a drop in TTV plasma load after conditioning treatment, with a progressive increase in the first months post-transplant, in parallel with the number of lymphocytes. In early stages of HSCT, a relation-ship between TTV replication kinetics and the probability of developing an infection by CMV has also been described. Likewise, the possible relationship of TTV with other complications of HSCT, such as Epstein-Barr virus infection (EBV) or graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), have been reported. However, not every study conducted to date show this line of results.

32989727|NCT02652910|The goal of this clinical trial is to study how approaches for manufacturing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T (CAR-T) cells affect their in vivo persistence and therapeutic efficacy against B lymphoma. Recently, cancer immunotherapy, treatments aiming to arm patients with immunity specifically against cancer cells, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Among the many emerging immunotherapeutic approaches, clinical trials utilizing CARs against B cell malignancies have demonstrated remarkable potential. CARs combine the variable region of an antibody with T-cell signaling moieties to confer T-cell activation with the targeting specificity of an antibody. Thus, CARs are not MHC-restricted so they are not vulnerable to MHC down regulation by tumors. However, defined by the activation and contraction program of their mother cells, the persistency and function of CAR-T cells are also restricted by the protocol of manufacturing. Previous clinical studies largely utilized interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the ex vivo expansion of CAR-T cells, which preferentially generate CAR-T cells with characteristics of terminally differentiated effector cells. Our preliminary data indicated that two common gamma chain cytokines, IL-7 and IL-15, can help to selectively expand CAR-T cells with various memory phenotypes. CAR-T Cells prepared under this condition resulted in improved therapeutic efficacy in preclinical animal models. This clinical investigation is to test a hypothesis whether IL-7/IL-15-programmed anti-CD19 CAR-T cells persist longer in lymphoma patients after infusion and whether the persistency of CAR-T cells can lead to improved anti-lymphoma efficacy.

A child or young adult with a refractory or recurrent CNS tumor will have their tumor tested for HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at their home institution or at Seattle Children's Hospital. If the tumor is HER2 positive and the patient meets all other eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meets none of the exclusion criteria, then they can be apheresed, meaning T cells will be collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets HER2-expressing tumor cells. The patient's newly engineered T cells will then be administered via the indwelling CNS catheter for two courses. In the first course they will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses for three weeks. Following the two courses, patient's will undergo a series of studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to continue receiving additional courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.~The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of HER2-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to complete two courses of treatment with three doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that HER-specific CAR T cells safely can be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study safely can be delivered directly into the brain via indwelling catheter. Secondary aims of the study will include to evaluate CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples from multiple time points are available, also evaluate the degree of HER2 expression at diagnosis versus at recurrence."

This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. Investigators hope that both will work better together.~Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to test whether these genetically modified T cells given after chemotherapy will be more effective at killing cancer cells.~The gene that will be put into the T cells makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells (CD30.CAR T cells) seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.~Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions, and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, doctors may use chemotherapy drugs to decrease the level of circulating T cells prior to the CD30.CAR T cells infusion. This is called lymphodepletion~CD30.CAR T cells have previously been studied in lymphoma patients."

This research study will use special immune system cells called TEGAR T cells, a new experimental treatment.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. The investigator found from preclinical research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will help them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In our preclinical studies, several genes were made called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GC33 that recognizes glypican-3, a protein found on almost all hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatoblastoma cells (GPC3-CAR). In the laboratory the investigators have been doing research into GPC3-CAR cells. They have selected the GPC3-CAR with the strongest ability to recognize hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells for this study. This is a safety study where the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients. The investigators also tested the effects of adding the molecule interleukin-15 (IL-15) alone or with another molecule called interleukin-21. The investigators found that IL-15 alone or together with IL-21 can help GPC3-CAR T cells last longer which helps them to kill more tumor cells. In this study the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients. This is a study looking at safety and the investigators will therefore be starting with GPC3-CAR T cells alone in a set of patients. The first set of patients will receive GPC3-CAR T cells that also express IL-15. In the second group, the investigators will evaluate GPC3-CAR T cells that express both IL-15 and IL-21. If the investigators are able to safely give GPC3- CAR T cells, they will increase the dose of the combination cells in other patients. The product or dose level of cells that the participant will receive is based on when they are enrolled on the study.~The GPC3-CAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.~The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of GPC3-CAR T cells that is safe, to see how long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the GPC3-CAR T cells will help people with GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma."

Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy may work better in treating children or young adults with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
32810381|NCT03233854|This phase I trial studies the side effects of CD19/CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells when given together with chemotherapy and NKTR-255, and to see how well they work in treating patients with CD19 positive B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. A CAR is a genetically-engineered receptor made so that immune cells (T cells) can attack cancer cells by recognizing and responding to the CD19/CD22 proteins. These proteins are commonly found on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. NKTR-255 is an investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy in combination with NKTR-255 may work better in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
32810443|NCT00085930|Patients have high-risk neuroblastoma, a form of cancer typically found in children. The patients previously participated in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease, antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other infections. T cells, also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CTLs, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill some tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers and while they have shown promise, they have not been strong enough to cure most patients. The antibody used in this study is called 14g2a. This antibody sticks to neuroblastoma cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called GD2. 14g2a and other antibodies that bind to GD2 have been used to treat people with neuroblastoma. For this study 14g2a has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood, it is now joined to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. T lymphocytes or CTLs can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the patient. Sometimes an antibody or chimeric receptor is attached to these T cells to help them bind to tumor cells. These chimeric receptor-T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long in the body and so the tumor eventually comes back. We have found that T cells that are also trained to recognize the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), can stay in the blood stream for many years. By joining the 14g2a antibody to the CTLs that recognize EBV, we believe we will make a cell that can last a long time in the body (because they are EBV-specific) and recognize and kill neuroblastoma cells (because an antibody that can recognize these cells has been placed on their surface). Patients received treatment with the immune cells described above. They may want to receive an additional dose of these cells. This is being offered as an option because their neuroblastoma has returned and they have enough cells remaining to provide the patients with an additional dose. These 14g2a antibody CTLs are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
33000706|NCT05077527|This phase I trial evaluates the side effects and usefulness of axicabtagene clioleucel (a CAR-T therapy) and find out what effect, if any, it has on treating patients with HIV-associated aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or not responded to treatment (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. Axicabtagene ciloleucel consists of genetically modified T cells, modified to recognize CD-19, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CD-19-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill CD-19-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells.

The study will be approved by the institutional review board of Beijing Boren Hospital, and informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All these participants will be matched the diagnostic criteria for (r/r) B-ALL according to the WHO classiﬁcation and complete morphological evaluation, immunophenotype analysis by flow cytometry (FCM), cytogenetic analysis by routine G-banding karyotype analysis and leukemia fusion gene screening by multiplex nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Participants will be eligible if they are heavily treated B-ALL who failed from re-induction chemotherapy after relapse or continued MRD+ for more than three months, and had positive CD19 and CD22 expressions on leukemia blasts by FCM (>95% CD19 and >95% CD22).

33000886|NCT03635632|"This study is for patients with neuroblastoma, sarcoma, uveal melanoma, breast cancer, or another cancer that expresses a substance on the cancer cells called GD2. The cancer has either come back after treatment or did not respond to treatment. Because there is no standard treatment at this time, patients are asked to volunteer in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells called T cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In our last clinical trial we made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) from an antibody that recognizes GD2, a substance found on almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). We put this gene into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to 11 neuroblastoma patients. We saw that the cells did grow for a while, but started to disappear from the blood after 2 weeks. We think that if T cells are able to last longer they may have a better chance of killing GD2 positive tumor cells.~Therefore, in this study we will add a new gene to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells to live longer. T cells need substances called cytokines to survive and the cells may not get enough cytokines after infusion. We have added the gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a longer period of time.~In other studies using T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and we think that it will allow the T cells to expand and stay longer in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.~The GD2-C7R T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.~The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-C7R T cells, and also to evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on cancer."

33182704|NCT02107963|"Background~GD2 is a well-characterized tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, which is also expressed on osteosarcomas and some other sarcomas. T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients with refractory neuroblastoma.~A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a caspase dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death of the genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.~Objectives~Primary:Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion.~Secondary:~Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors;~Measure persistence of adoptively transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this with antitumor effects;~Extend information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in non-neuroblastoma, non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults;~If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity; and~Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.~Eligibility~Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor (including neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard therapy and is deemed incurable by standard therapy.~Design~After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide 1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3 dose escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the highest dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients.~Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.~Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 60 days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met.~A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36 patients for treatment.

Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers.

In the lab, we made several genes called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GC33. The antibody GC33 recognizes a protein called GPC3 that is found on the hepatocellular carcinoma the patient has. The specific CAR we are making is called GPC3-CAR. To make this CAR more effective, we also added a gene encoding protein called IL15. This protein helps CAR T cells grow better and stay in the blood longer so that they may kill tumors better. The mixture of GPC3-CAR and IL15 killed tumor cells better in the laboratory when compared with CAR T cells that did not have IL 15. This study will test T cells that we have made with CATCH T cells in patients with GPC3-positive solid tumors such as the ones participating in this study.~T cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed when they encounter a specific drug called AP1903.

32815087|NCT04381741|Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, accounting for 35% of lymphoma. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is a new method to treat DLBCL. KTE-C19, published in the New England Medical Journal in December 2017, was used to treat relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma. One year of treatment for 111 patients, the total response rate was 82%, and the complete remission rate was 54%. However, a large number of clinical studies have shown that about 20% of patients with B-ALL and 50% of patients with B-NHL cannot achieve complete remission (CR) after CD19-CAR-T treatment. Targeting tumor microenvironment is an important new method to overcome the drug resistance of CAR-T cells. In this study, IL-7 and CCL19 were connected on the basis of traditional second generation CD19 CAR-T cells to construct novel fourth generation CAR-T cells, which can promote the infiltration, accumulation and survival of CAR-T cells in lymphoma tissue, and further enhance the anti-tumor effect of traditional CAR-T cells. At the same time, combined with four generations of CAR-T cells and PD1 monoclonal antibody, PD1 / PDL1 signal pathway was blocked, anti-tumor effect of CAR-T was improved, and immune response and long-term remission rate of DLBCL were improved.

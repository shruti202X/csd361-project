Partial Response (PR) is ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. Progressive Disease (PD) ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes, or appearance of a new lesion greater than 1.5 cm in any axis even if other lesions are decreasing in size.

Progressive disease (PD) is defined by ≥50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes, or if a single node is involved at least a 50% increase in the product of the diameters of this one node; and appearance of a new lesion greater than 1.5 cm in any axis even if other lesions are decreasing in size. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.|Participants|Count of Participants|0|0.0||||||

Definite development of new bone lesions or new plasmacytoma. Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR) is serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis. Stringent Complete Remission (sCR) is normal free light chain ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry. Complete Remission is negative immunofixation on the serum and urine. Stable Disease (SD) is not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or PD.|Participants|Count of Participants|2|2.0||||||

Responses are coded so that a '1' indicates no problem, and '5' indicates the most serious problem. The responses for the 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit number. These health states are converted to a single index value using the crosswalk method to the EQ-5D-3L value set from the United Kingdom (UK). The EQ-5D-5L health states ranged from -.594 for the worst (55555) to 1 for the best (11111) for UK value set with an optimal health state is assigned a score of 1.00, death is assigned a score of 0.00 and negative values representing values as worse than dead.

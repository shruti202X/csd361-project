55960730|NCT04863066|Biological|CAR-T cells|The presence of latent infected cells remains a key barrier to HIV-1 functional cure. Current approach to reducing the latent HIV reservoir is to reactivate virus-containing cells to make them be detected and eliminated by host defense. Endogenous cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) may not be adequate because of cellular exhaustion and immune escape of virus. We have designed a kind of CAR-T cell based on CTL engineered to express a scFv of a broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibody. According to our preclinical studies, CAR-T cells strongly eradicated HIV-1-infected target cells making them a particularly suitable candidate to reach a functional HIV cure. In this clinical trial, we mainly intend to evaluate the safety of CAR-T-Cell therapy on HIV patients whose plasma HIV has been successfully suppressed after antiviral therapy.

56180333|NCT04691713|Drug|Targeting CD276 autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cells|Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (car-t) is one of the most effective therapies for malignant tumors (especially hematological tumors). Like other immunotherapies, the basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to clear cancer cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (car) is the core component of car-t, which endows T cells with the ability to recognize tumor antigens in an independent manner, which enables car modified T cells to recognize a wider range of targets than natural T cell surface receptors (TCR). The basic design of car includes a tumor associated antigen binding region (usually derived from scFv segment of monoclonal antibody antigen binding region), transmembrane region and intracellular signal region. The selection of target antigen is a key determinant for the specificity and effectiveness of car and the safety of genetically modified T cells.

56189400|NCT04650724|Drug|T cell infusion agent targeting BCMA chimeric antigen receptor|Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (car-t) is one of the most effective therapies for malignant tumors (especially hematological tumors). Like other immunotherapies, the basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to clear cancer cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (car) is the core component of car-t, which endows T cells with the ability to recognize tumor antigens in an independent manner, which enables car modified T cells to recognize a wider range of targets than natural T cell surface receptors (TCR). The basic design of car includes a tumor associated antigen binding region (usually derived from scFv segment of monoclonal antibody antigen binding region), transmembrane region and intracellular signal region. The selection of target antigen is a key determinant for the specificity and effectiveness of car and the safety of genetically modified T cells.

The combination we propose to test has the potential to overcome each of the established individual limitations of oncolytic viruses and of CAR T-cells. Testing each element separately would not be beneficial or informative, since the combination therapy is anticipated to have unique profiles of both therapeutic benefit and potential toxicities.

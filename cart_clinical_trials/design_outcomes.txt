189973125|NCT05190653|primary|Patient quality of life|3 months||The primary outcome of the study, QOL, will be assessed using the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire - Expanded (MQOL-E) summary score of QOL monthly for a period of three months. The MQOL-E consists of 21 items with possible scores of 0 to 10 for each item. The higher the score, the better the QOL. The trajectories of QOL will be evaluated rather than looking at change in scores as it is anticipated that there will be significant fluctuation in QOL scores over time. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) will also be used to measure QOL. The FACT-BMT is more specific to BMT and may capture issues that are unique to BMT. The FACT-BMT consists of 47 items; a 5-point Likert-type scale is used for item. The total score ranges from 0-196 and higher scores indicate better QOL.
189973126|NCT05190653|secondary|Patient symptom burden|3 months||The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) is a validated scale that assesses symptom burden in patients with cancer. While several iterations of the ESAS are available, this study will use the ESAS-revised (ESAS-r) which includes 10 items scored using a numeric rating scale, where 0=no symptom and 10=worst symptom. The ESAS assesses physical symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea, drowsiness, dyspnea, loss of appetite), emotional symptoms (anxiety and depression), and well-being. Individual patient scores will be tracked over time to assess the trajectory of symptom burden.
189973127|NCT05190653|secondary|Patient and family caregiver prognostic understanding|3 months||The Perception of Treatment and Prognosis Questionnaire (PTPQ) is 10 item self-report questionnaire that assesses patients' beliefs about the likelihood of cure, the importance and helpfulness of knowing about prognosis, the primary goal of cancer treatment, the preferences for information about treatment, and the satisfaction with quality of information provided regarding prognosis and treatment. Items on the questionnaire are scored individually with statements about the degree to which the patient agrees with each item. Patients and CGs will complete the PTPQ pre-HSCT/CAR T-cell therapy and at 3 months post HSCT/CAR T-cell therapy.
189973128|NCT05190653|secondary|Family caregiver quality of life|3 months||The Quality of Life in Life-Threatening Illness - Family carer version 2 (QOLLTI-F v2) will be used to assess CG QOL. The QOLLTI-Fv2 is a 17-item questionnaire that includes seven subscales that assess the following domains: environment, patient condition, the CG's own state, quality of care, relationships, and financial worries. In addition, there is a single item that pertains to overall QOL. Items on the QOLLTI-Fv2 are ranked from 0-10 (total possible score ranges from 0-170), where higher scores are associated with better QOL. Caregivers in both the intervention and standard care arms will complete the QOLLTI-Fv2 pre-HSCT/CAR T-cell therapy, and at 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months post-HSCT/CAR T-cell therapy.

Responses are provided on a 5-point Likert scale: Frequency item: How OFTEN did you have? (Never / Rarely / Occasionally / Frequently / Almost constantly); Severity item: What was the SEVERITY of your at its WORST? (None / Mild / Moderate / Severe / Very severe);Interference item: How much did INTERFERE with your usual or daily activities? (Not at all / A little bit / Somewhat / Quite a bit / Very much)

Physical Function is inclusive of the term disability and includes the full spectrum of physical functioning from severe impairment to exceptional physical abilities. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five, resulting in a total score (T-score) from 0 to 100. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Physical Function, a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average. By comparison, a Physical Function T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average."

Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five, which are summed into T-score values for physical and mental health. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. Thus, a person who has T- scores of 60 for the Global Physical Health or Global Mental Health scales is one standard deviation better (more healthy) than the general population."

EQ-5D-VAS: range 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better self-reported health status. A positive change indicates an improvement.

190761066|NCT03483103|secondary|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Assessed by the EuroQol Instrument EQ-5D-5L|Baseline and Day 29||The European Quality of Life 5D-5L Scale (EQ-5D-5L) assesses general health-related quality of life. Health is defined in 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses are coded so that a '1' indicates no problem, and '5' indicates the most serious problem. The responses for the 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit number. These health states are converted to a single index value using the crosswalk method to the EQ-5D-3L value set from the United Kingdom (UK). The EQ-5D-5L health states ranged from -.594 for the worst (55555) to 1 for the best (11111) for UK value set with an optimal health state is assigned a score of 1.00, death is assigned a score of 0.00 and negative values representing values as worse than dead. A change of .08 is considered to be a clinically meaningful change in health utility.

Each dimension was divided into 5 levels of severity: No problem, Slight problems, Moderate problems, Severe problems, and Extreme problems (unable to perform). EQ-5D health states, defined by the EQ-5D descriptive system, are converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that attaches values (also called QOL weights or QOL utilities) to each of the levels in each dimension.

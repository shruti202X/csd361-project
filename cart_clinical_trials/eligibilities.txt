Patients with primary cutaneous DLBCL of leg-type are eligible if the lymphoma expresses cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) and if the insurance approves the CAR-T therapy. Similarly. Large cell transformation of nodal or extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma is eligible only if the insurance allows and the disease shows strong CD19 positivity. On the other hand, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are not allowed due to the frequently required continuation of immunosuppression to avoid organ rejection.~Primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL)~Transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL). An untransformed follicular lymphoma grade 3B will be considered on a case by case basis, since the genetic signature of grade 3B follicular lymphoma frequently resemble that of DLBCL and the large lymphomatous cells just happen to be organized in a follicular pattern.

In questionable cases, a biopsy should confirm persistence of disease as part of standard of care. In case of mantle cell lymphoma, the primary therapy if does not include an anthracycline, should include either high doses of cytarabine +/-bendamustine and an anti-CD20 antibody (usually rituximab).~Relapsed disease that fails to respond (CR or PR) after at least 2 cycles of a platinum and/or cytarabine-based chemotherapy. For the purpose of this study, appropriate regimens include: rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (R-ICE), rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP), rituximab dexamethasone cytarabine oxaliplatin (R-DHAOx), rituximab, gemcitabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone (R-GDP). Rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-Gem-Ox) is considered appropriate if the patient fails to obtain at least a PR after 4 doses of oxaliplatin. Patients with MCL who relapse after an anthracycline, bendamustine or cytarabine-based regimen, should have failed two salvage attempts: a molecularly targeting-based regimen including at least a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor with or without venetoclax and a cytotoxic traditional second salvage regimen, unless the two salvage approaches are combined. For example if they fail a salvage with R-ICE + a BTK-inhibitor in combination, they are eligible without the need to be exposed to more therapy. Patients with PMBCL, they should also have failed a traditional salvage regimen and a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor-based salvage.~Relapse after an autologous stem cell transplantation. At least 3 months should have lapsed between autologous stem cell infusion and initiation of pre-CAR-T lymphodepleting chemotherapy due to the risk of prolonged cytopenias.~At least one of the lymphoma lesions should be measurable. For the purpose of this study an involved nodal lesion should be at least 1.5 cm in the longest diameter, while extra-nodal lymphoma lesions should have their longest diameter ≥1.0 cm~Lymphoma cells need to be CD19 positive.

Given the high homology (>90%) between JC and BK and the fact that BKVSTs targeting VP1 and Large T (as targeted in our multivirus MVSTs) have been administered to treat JCV-PML, and produced viral clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid, it is likely that our MVSTs will have efficacy against JC virus. Given the current lack of treatment options for JC virus infection or reactivation after HSCT and the risk of progression to JML, which is almost uniformly fatal, and the apparent activity of BK virus- directed T cells against JC virus infected cells, we propose including patients with JC virus on this study, unless a suitable alternative therapy is available.~i.

participant without clinically significant encephalopathy/new focal deficits~Infectious diseases: no clinical evidence of uncontrolled active infectious process~ALLOGENEIC DONOR CRITERIA FOR APHERESIS DONATION:~Related donor selection will be conducted in accordance with City of Hope's Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation criteria and, in the case of unrelated donor from a transplant center, will comply with the National Marrow Donor Program's (NMDP) donor selection standards; when a potentially eligible recipient of an unrelated donor product from an NMDP Center is identified, the recipient will complete an NMDP search transfer request to allow City of Hope (COH) NMDP staff to contact the NMDP Coordinating Center, who in turn, will contact the donor's prior Donor Center; the search will follow the NMDP Policy for subsequent donation requests; any form deemed appropriate and necessary by the NMDP, including the Subsequent Donation Request Form, Therapeutic T Cell Collection Prescription and Therapeutic Stem Cell Collection Prescription, will be submitted as required~In the case of a related donor: The identified donor must be the original donor whose stem cells were used for the research participant's allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT)~For both related and unrelated donors: The donor's hepatitis B surface antigen must be negative and the hepatitis C antibody must be nonreactive; in the case of a positive hepatitis C antibody result, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will have to be performed and the results should be negative~Exclusion Criteria:~Research participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active or poorly controlled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, poorly controlled pulmonary disease or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; such social situations include but are not limited to lack of reliable means of transportation for follow up, inability to make time for required clinic visits due to work or family needs, or lack of reliable ways of communication with the study team in the event that the participant is seriously ill~Research participants who have tested human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, or have active hepatitis B or C infection based on testing performed within 4 weeks of enrollment~Research participants with presence of other active malignancy. However, research participants with history of prior malignancy treated with curative intent and in complete remission are eligible~Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study~Study-Specific Exclusion~Failure of research participant to understand the basic elements of the protocol and/or the risks/benefits of participating in this phase I study~History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to cetuximab~Dependence on corticosteroids:~If the participant is undergoing leukapheresis: physiological replacement doses of steroids are allowed - prednisone no more than 7.5 mg, hydrocortisone less than 12 mg/m^2/day~However, all participants must be able to reduce steroid requirement to no more than physiological replacement doses prior to start of lymphodepletion~Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy~Research participants will be excluded, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study"|||t|t|t
